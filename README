#Glovebox: Simple file sharing

##About
Glovebox is designed to help out with file transfers. It's designed to be super easy to use from the user's perspective.

An administrator creates a share which is tied to an email address. The user can then upload files to the share with a randomly generated link that is (optionally) emailed to them.

Administrators are also able to create shares & uploads arbitrarily.

Once a share is created, random links to the resources are created.
